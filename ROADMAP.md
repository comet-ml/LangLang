# LangLang Development Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development roadmap for LangLang, detailing our planned features and improvements for the coming quarters.

## Q2 2024: Enhanced Multi-Modal Capabilities

### Vision-Language Integration
We are excited to announce the upcoming integration of advanced vision-language capabilities into LangLang. This enhancement will enable seamless processing of both textual and visual inputs through our unified interface.

```python
from langlang import VisionProcessor, MultiModalChain

# Initialize the vision processor
vision = VisionProcessor()

# Create a multi-modal chain
chain = MultiModalChain(
    vision_processor=vision,
    llm=OpenAI(),
    prompt="Describe this image in the style of {style}"
)

# Process both image and text
result = chain.process(
    image="path/to/image.jpg",
    style="Shakespearean"
)
```

Key features:
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Leveraging state-of-the-art vision models
- **Seamless Integration**: Unified API for both text and image inputs
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Intelligent understanding of visual context
- **Enterprise-Grade Features**: Production-ready image processing pipeline

## Q3 2024: Cross-Platform Expansion

### F# Integration
LangLang is expanding beyond Python to provide a comprehensive, cross-platform solution. Our F# integration will bring the power of LangLang to the .NET ecosystem.

```fsharp
open LangLang

let llm = OpenAI(apiKey = "your-api-key")

let generateStory (prompt: string) =
    let chain = LangChain.Chain(
        llm = llm,
        prompt = "Write a story about {topic}"
    )
    chain.Run(topic = prompt)
```

Key features:
- **Native F# Support**: Full integration with F# type system
- **Seamless Interop**: Easy interaction between F# and Python components
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging F# performance characteristics
- **Enterprise-Grade Features**: Production-ready F# integration

## Q4 2024: Distributed Computing

### LangLang MCP (Master Control Program) Server
Introducing the LangLang MCP Server, a distributed computing framework that enables seamless coordination of multiple LangLang instances across your infrastructure.

```python
from langlang.mcp import MCPServer, WorkerNode

# Initialize the MCP server
mcp = MCPServer(
    host="localhost",
    port=8080,
    max_workers=1000
)

# Register worker nodes
worker = WorkerNode(
    capabilities=["text", "vision", "audio"],
    load_balancing=True
)
mcp.register_worker(worker)

# Deploy distributed chains
chain = DistributedChain(
    mcp=mcp,
    strategy="dynamic-load-balancing"
)
result = chain.process(
    input="Hello, distributed world!",
    workers=10
)
```

Key features:
- **Distributed Processing**: Seamless coordination across multiple nodes
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Intelligent resource allocation
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery from node failures
- **Enterprise-Grade Features**: Production-ready distributed computing

## Future Considerations

### Quantum Computing Integration
We are exploring the potential of quantum computing to enhance LangLang's processing capabilities. This is currently in the research phase.

### Blockchain-Based Model Registry
A decentralized system for managing and versioning LLM models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

### Neural Interface Support
Direct integration with neural interfaces for enhanced human-AI interaction (subject to regulatory approval).
